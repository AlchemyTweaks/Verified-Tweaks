> [!WARNING]  
> Here you will find the 'Verified Tweaks' category, which means it contains settings and modifications that have been tested by me through video. This category has 2 subcategories: 1) **Recommended Tweaks**: meaning I recommend using them, and 2) **Unrecommended Tweaks**: meaning I do not recommend using them. However, it should be emphasized that in both cases, you are responsible for conducting your own measurements.
